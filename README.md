# easyCalc-app
A simple calculator built with pure JS, HTML, CSS and FontAwesome icons.

This project is part of my learning journey in frontend development, focusing on application logic, DOM, and version control with GitHub.
The app already works, but I plan to expand and refine it over time.
I’m intentionally building it step-by-step and committing updates to show real development progress over time.

CURENT FEATURES:
Basic math operations: +, -, *, /
Multi-digit number input
Decimal support
AC button- full reset
Error handling (division by zero...)
Chained operations (5 + 3 * 2...)
Light/Dark mode toggle


PLANNED UPDATES:

Percentage handling and sign change button features are temporarily removed to reimplement it properly.

PRO MODE as a scientific calculator with calculation history log

Showing the selected operator on screen - currently, clicking an operator does not display it on the calculator screen.

Improve clarity of calculation flow

General code improvements

Refactoring existing code


HOW TO RUN
